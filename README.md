This application demonstrates how APIs can be leveraged to import content into a webpage

The user is invited to enter search criteria into the search bar
Upon hitting the Search button, a new button is created in the pane below.

When the user then clicks that button, an API call is made to GIPHY, and 10 GIFs are retrieved  (all 'G' rated) and displayed to the screen, along with select information (title, rating, import date).

Each GIF can then be played or paused, by clicking on it.

Additionally, the user can identify his/her favorite GIFs (using the 'Save as favorite' button), and those GIFs can be played in a designated area, that has now appeared at the top of the page.

Once the user has viewed the desired GIFs, the page can be cleared using the 'Clear' button at the top.

The page is designed to be a responsive layout.
